	<p>I view media creation as a process of storytelling and crafting my own unique meaning. Within my family, I often sense the gap between tradition and modernity. My parents place greater emphasis on stability, while I have gradually encountered multiculturalism and emerging media through my studies and interests. I came to understand that creation can be a way to express myself. The first time I truly realized that "media" is not merely the content being watched, but an immersive experience, was at a concert. That day, as the music played and the entire crowd sang along, I suddenly felt a connection that transcended language and culture. That collective emotion deeply moved me and sparked a strong curiosity about how art can, in just a few hours, make people forget their differences and come together. From that moment on, I developed a lasting interest in music, visuals, and the emotional power they carry.</p>
	<p>The two creators who have influenced me the most are Hayao Miyazaki and Keshi. Miyazaki's works have shown me that art can be both imaginative and aesthetically powerful. The worlds he creates always remind me to pay attention to nature, personal growth, and the connections between people. In contrast, Keshi's music with its deeply personal and delicate emotional expression. His creations have made me believe that emotions can also transcend cultural boundaries and resonate with a global audience. Although these two creators come from different fields and backgrounds, they have both inspired me to reflect on how to use my work to express my individuality while also touching a broader audience. I believe that creation cannot be completely separated from social and political contexts. Whether it's about gender equality, cultural diversity, or identity, I hope to address these themes in my work and evoke both emotional resonance and thoughtful reflection among the audience. I also hope that my work can show the audience that art is not just a form of personal expression, but also a bridge between people. Despite our differences, emotions are something we can all share. Media shapes the way we receive information and profoundly influences societal culture and values.</p>
