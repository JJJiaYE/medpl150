	<h1>Exit 5x7</h1>
	<img src="images/2.jpg"/>
	<p>I chose this image because it possesses a strong and direct visual symbolism. The 5x7 vertical composition reinforces the sense of leading to the exit, with the entire image focused on the sign itself. The bold typography creates a clear visual focal point, while the bright sign contrasts with the relatively dark background, heightening the image's tension. During post processing, I chose to emphasize the red lighting, creating a strong contrast between light and shadow that underscores a sense of oppression and critical importance of the escape route.</p>
