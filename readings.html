	<h1>Response</h1>
	<p>This article reveals the issue of an overabundance of Al-generated content, while also highlighting the dislocation of reality caused by Al. Al has split people's lives into two parallel, illusory worlds: one consists of real news and events, and the other is filled with a large amount of fake news and low-quality content generated by Al. This division made me realize that, although I frequently encounter Al-generated content in my daily internet use, I have grown accustomed to the mix of truth and falsehood online without ever reflecting on the impact Al has on us. In particular, the author's mention of Al-generated political fantasies made me realize that Al can now be used not only to create entertainment content but also to manufacture ideology. It can unconsciously stir intense emotions in people and spread rapidly, making it more dangerous than ordinary propaganda because it requires no cost and knows no boundaries. Traditional propaganda requires resources and time, whereas modern propaganda now only needs a prompt. More importantly, these images do not even need to be fully believed. This article also reminded me of the journalism course I took last semester, where we had heated discussions about Al. As Al image and video technology continues to advance, it has become increasingly difficult for people to distinguish between what is real and what is fake. Many Al-generated videos online are mistaken for genuine news or political content. As a result, when political content is manipulated by Al into videos designed to provoke public outrage, people's first reaction is not to verify its authenticity, but to spread it quickly, which is not the right thing to do. When fake content aligns with people's pre-existing political beliefs, it is still selectively believed even when it is pointed out to be Al-generated. I share the author's concern that, in today's environment, we are seeing more and more, and feeling less and less.Perhaps this is the truly troubling aspect of the Al era. All content is compressed into the same entertainment framework, reduced to visual snippets that can be swiped away. The result is not that we are unaware of what is happening in the world, but that we have lost the capacity for genuine shock and the impulse to act. It turns real-world events into entertainment while blurring the line between truth and fiction.The real challenge, then, is not how to completely avoid Al-generated content, but rather how to rebuild our ability to discern reality.</p>
